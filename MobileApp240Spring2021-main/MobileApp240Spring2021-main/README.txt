CIS-240 Spring2021 MobileApp

  This is the application repo for the init coding
(proof-of-concept) for the desktop/mobile application 
Chow King. The app is supposed to allow a user to input
various criteria for a restaurant, within a set distance,
and press a "roll" to randomly pick a restaurant in their
local area. The picker is similar to a slot machine that
still allows users to have some measure of control over 
their meals, including the ability to reroll if they
change their minds or dislike the result of the roll.

  The status of the application included in this repo
as proof of concept means its functionality is limited
in its scope, and pulls restaurant information from a
locally hosted dataset instead of talking to the internet
directly. Additional functionality includes linking of roll
results to the user's Map applications on their phones, as 
well as links to Yelp or Google reviews and/or Facebook pages.
